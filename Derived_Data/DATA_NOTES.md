# Vertical Profile Data from Maine's Department of Environmental Protection

This data file was developed by CBEP based on data from Maine's Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP).

Angie Brewer, of Maine DEP, shared data derived from DEP's "EGAD" data 
system via an Excel File, "Curtis Bohlen 051021.xlsx".  Much of the data
was sent to CBEP because of its implications for nutrients in
Casco Bay.  We conducted a detailed review and reorganization of the
data.  Original data and related R notebooks documenting the data 
reorganization steps are in the DEP_Nutrients repository.  

This file was a result of that reorganization.  Specifically, we extracted 
data that contained data from "downcasts" of water quality sondes so that
we could take a closer look at patterns of vertical stratification.

## combined_locations.csv
We created this table when we combined data on monitoring locations 
tracked by FOCB and MAine DEP.  Details are in the 
`Combined_Nutrients` GitHub archive.  It includes information on location
of sampling sites used by DEP and FOCB.  We use it here because it offers
a regionalization of sampling stations. to compare "inshore" vs "offshore" 
stations in trend analyses.
